              <h1>Me in a Nut Shell</h1>
              <h4> My life in the future</h4>
              <p> What I imagine my life in the future is being a great developer and being able to create web pages that help small buisnesses expand their advertising on the web. I also want to be able to work with a diverse group of people that enjoy the same things as me. I know that at this point in my life I have no experience in this field and want to network and grow what I know.</p>
              <p><h4>A little about my likes</h4></p>
              <p class= "more-content">I love the color green due to being an easy color for me to see. I am partially color blind and cannot distingish between darker colors. World of Warcraft is my game of choice being that my younger brother and I were able to connect better while I was in foreign countries and have really not been able to give up on my characters. I have a huge diversity of music from grounge to rap. I don't have a favorite band due to everything that I listen to is greatness.</p>
              <p><h4>What I Hate about my car</h4></p>
              <p id= "something-else">I <b>hate my car</b> because it doesn't run and I am too lazy to fix it being a mechanic. They say that a mechanics car is worse than the cars that they work on. From my experience that saying is very very true. I hate working on my own car because it is a bucket of bolts and I hate it. I can't express enough how much I hate my car. I have a granny car for one so when I am riding around people are laughing at me I can feel it. The color of this said sad car is puke green and I will never drive this car again. I will blow it up here in the future when I get a new one that runs. </p>
